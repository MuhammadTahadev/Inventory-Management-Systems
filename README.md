# Basic Inventory Management System

This is a basic Inventory Management System built with PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS. The project provides a foundational structure for managing inventory with user authentication, a dashboard interface, and a pricing page with subscription plans.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionality to manage user access.
- **Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard to view and manage inventory data.
- **Pricing Plans:** UI for different subscription plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with plan details displayed.
- **Inventory Tracking:** Basic functionalities implied for managing products and stock.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and intuitive UI built with CSS and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Server-side scripting for backend logic and database interactions.
- **MySQL:** Database management for storing user and inventory data.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting for dynamic and interactive elements.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout for a polished and responsive interface.

## Important Note

While the project includes UI components and database structure for pricing and subscription plans, the actual backend implementation for pricing features, plan benefits, and payment processing is not yet implemented. For example, the pricing page displays plan options and features, but the "Choose" buttons do not link to any functional purchase or plan activation process.

The login process checks for user plans and redirects users accordingly, but enforcement of plan-specific features or benefits is not present.

This project serves as a foundational structure that can be extended with full feature implementation in the future.

## Usage

1. Set up a local server environment with PHP and MySQL (e.g., XAMPP).
2. Import the database schema and data as required.
3. Configure the database connection in `db_connection.php`.
4. Access the application via the local server URL.
5. Use the signup and login pages to create and access user accounts.
6. Explore the dashboard and pricing pages for inventory management and subscription options.

## Future Improvements

- Implement backend logic for pricing plan purchases and payment processing.
- Enforce plan-specific features and access control.
- Add detailed inventory management functionalities.
- Enhance UI/UX for better user interaction.
- Implement reporting and analytics features.
